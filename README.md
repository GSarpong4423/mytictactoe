Javascript to build the game logic - creating the game board, X and O.
JQuery to add events  such as click funtions

## Challenges 

I learned as much more by being hands on but struggled in many areas. I am still uncertain on how to to create a function that will declare a winner. I don't know how to add my the API. At this momemnt my project would considered incpmplete. I plan on completing this project if I get assitance. 

# Finally..
This was a very hard project to attempt and I did being that I didnt know anything about programming.I tried the best that I could and very thankful for the classmates that assist me through the little bit that I have and hopefully the logic sticks so I can complete.
